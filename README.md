# the-food-index
This is a team project that creates a full stack MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) single-page application that allows the user to find restaurants by cuisine and order food from a restaurant if they desire. The user can add items to their cart but must have an account and be signed in to checkout.
